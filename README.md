# Burgers

This project implements the use of MySQL ORM to utilize handlebars within an MVC
framework

Also handlebars is utilized to fill out the UI layout in a dynamic manner

## How To Use

The burgers are sorted into two categories: devoured and not devoured.

The burgers are pulled from the MySQL database with their name and devoured
status (False or True).

Each burger that has not been devoured will have a "Devour It!" button beside it
so that the user may "devour" it.

There is a text input field to add burgers that the user would like to eat. By
default, the burger is set to devoured status- False.
